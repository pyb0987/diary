I created the Programmers repository. I think I shouldnt abuse more and make one when I have project.

But apart from that I feel that I need to study about a lot of things.

Currently I'm covering JQuery by my own. And jsp in the academy.

I heard about Ajax so many times but I really don't know nothing about it.

I expect that I can start the new project with those soon. I have some candidates in my mind.
